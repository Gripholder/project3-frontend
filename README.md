              Accountabil-a-buddy

Never procrastinate again!! Wouldn't that be nice?!

Basic concept of our app
  - create a task of something you need to get done
  - set a date for that task
  - submit it and forget it!
  - Once you set your task you will not be able to adjust the due date and you will get text     reminders to perform your task until it is accomplished.
  - The only way to stop the text messages is to assign an Accountabil-a-buddy to your account and they can send you a unique code which will allow you to cross off that task!

Told you, you will never procrastinate again!!
